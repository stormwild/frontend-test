# Front End Test

The purpose of this exercise it to assess front-end skills.

Check the mockup PNG files contained in this archive.
The objective is to build a simple program that will fetch weather data
from an external service and display it to the user.

A web server configuration is included in the project.

To install it you need to run: `npm install`
To execute the server, simply run `npm run server`

There will be two available apis at the following addresses:
http://localhost:8081/api/weather0.json
http://localhost:8081/api/weather1.json

The application will have to consume these apis and display the data
in the interface.

There should be an hamburger menu to switch between services, as shown
in the mockup.

Feel free to pick any technology that you prefer.

What's expected:
    - The code should be clean and concise
    - Follow the best practices as much as possible

Extra goals:
	- Modern front-end framework
	- Unit tests
	- Add a dropdown to select the temperature unit

You've got no time limit.

Zip it and send it back to us when you're finished.
